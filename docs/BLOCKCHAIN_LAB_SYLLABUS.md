## Mini Project
- Students should carry out mini-project in a group of three/four students with a subject In-charge
- The group should meet with the concerned faculty during laboratory hours and the progress of work discussed must be documented
- Each group should perform a detailed literature survey and formulate a problem statement
- Each group will identify the hardware and software requirement for their defined mini project problem statement
- Design, develop and test their smart contract/chain code
- Each group may present their work in various project competitions and paper presentations
