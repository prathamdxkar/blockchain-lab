**Here is the template for creating the EXP-X_DOC.md file for each experiments**
```markdown

# Exp-X: Blockchain Lab Evaluation File

---

## AIM: Name of the experiment from `docs/BLOCKCHAIN_LAB_MANUAL.md`

---

## THEORY: 
```markdown
Theory about the technology stack used in the experiment in 250-300 lines. No proses, only bullet points and statements. Definition and origin are mandatory, example snippet (optional) and needs to be accurate according to current time/date/month (Year is 2026 && Web Search usage is mandatory).
```

---

## IMPLEMENTATION:

### CODE: 
```markdown
In the CODE subsection it is mandatory to include code snippets from appropriate files which contribute to the functionality of that particular experiment. The code subsection should include the file name and its specific functional code inside a snippet or code block with language description (i.e. Solidity, JavaScript, etc.). Ensure that minimum 3 and maximum 8 code snippets are included in the CODE subsection.
```

---

### OUTPUT:
```markdown
In the OUTPUT subsection it is mandatory to include the screenshots of webpage, transactions, terminal outputs, extension outputs, etc. It is mandatory to include the screenshot with its name (i.e. "Fig X.Y Screenshot_Name" OR "Fig X.Y.Z Screenshot_Name") where X is the experiment number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 OR 6), Y is the main category image number (any Real number) and Z is the subcategory image number (any Real number) of the OUTPUT subsection.
```

---

## LAB OUTCOMES:
```markdown
Any one of the Lab Outcomes (LO) from the `docs/BLOCKCHAIN_LAB_MANUAL.md` which are mapped to the particular experiment
LO1: Develop and test smart contract on local Blockchain.
LO2: Develop and test smart contract on Ethereum test networks.
LO3: Write and deploy smart contract using Remix IDE and Metamask.
LO4: Design and develop Cryptocurrency.
LO5: Write and deploy chain code in Hyperledger Fabric.
LO6: Develop and test a Full-fledged DApp using Ethereum/Hyperledger.
```

---

## CONCLUSION
```markdown
A 2-3 lines statement concluding the current experiment with mandatory usage of the following phrases ("We've sucessfully completed/implemented/performed the current experiment ...and so on"). Ensure there are no bullet points, or lenghty proses involved in the CONCLUSION as it should be precise and to the point.
```
