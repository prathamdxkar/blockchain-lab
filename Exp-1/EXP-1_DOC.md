## AIM

<!-- TODO: Copy verbatim from docs/BLOCKCHAIN_LAB_MANUAL.md -->
To Develop and Establish local Blockchain using Truffle.

---

## THEORY

<!-- TODO: Write 250–300 words (bullet points only, no prose).
     Mandatory web search to verify current versions before writing.
     Cover: Truffle Suite (version, year, org), Ganache (version), Ethereum basics,
     smart contract definition, local blockchain concept, Web3 stack. -->

---

## IMPLEMENTATION

### CODE

<!-- TODO: Include 3–8 code snippets in logical execution order:
     1. SimpleStorage.sol (or experiment contract) — SPDX + pragma + struct/state/functions skeleton
     2. Truffle migration script (migrations/1_deploy_*.js)
     3. Truffle config network block (truffle-config.js — development network)
     4. Hardhat config network block (hardhat.config.js — ganache network)
     5. Hardhat test file (test/*.test.js — key test case)
     Refer to docs/EXP-X_DOC_RULE.md §7.1 for snippet rules. -->

---

### OUTPUT

<!-- TODO: Add screenshots saved in Exp-1/screenshots/.
     Minimum required:
       Fig 1.1 — Ganache GUI: 10 test accounts with 100 ETH each
       Fig 1.2 — Truffle migrate: contract deployment output
       Fig 1.3 — Hardhat test suite: all tests passing
     Follow naming: fig-1.Y-description.png (kebab-case, no spaces).
     Refer to docs/EXP-X_DOC_RULE.md §7.2 for screenshot rules. -->

---

## LAB OUTCOMES

<!-- TODO: Copy verbatim from docs/BLOCKCHAIN_LAB_MANUAL.md -->
**LO1** — Develop and test smart contract on local Blockchain.

---

## CONCLUSION

<!-- TODO: Write exactly 2–3 sentences.
     Mandatory opener: "We have successfully..."
     Mention: SimpleStorage (or actual contract name), Truffle, Ganache, LO1 achieved.
     No bullet points. Refer to docs/EXP-X_DOC_RULE.md §9. -->
