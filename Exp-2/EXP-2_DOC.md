# Exp-2: To Develop and Establish Smart Contract and Chain Code

> **Status**: 🔴 Pending — complete the experiment fully before writing this file.
> Refer to `docs/EXP-X_DOC_RULE.md` for all authoring rules.

---

## AIM

<!-- TODO: Copy verbatim from docs/BLOCKCHAIN_LAB_MANUAL.md -->
To Develop and Establish smart contract and chain code.

---

## THEORY

<!-- TODO: Write 250–300 words (bullet points only, no prose).
     Mandatory web search to verify current versions before writing.
     Cover: Solidity language (version, year, EVM target), smart contract lifecycle
     (write → compile → deploy → interact), chaincode definition (Hyperledger context),
     ABI/bytecode, contract migration, Web3.js/ethers.js interaction model. -->

---

## IMPLEMENTATION

### CODE

<!-- TODO: Include 3–8 code snippets in logical execution order:
     1. Main Solidity contract — SPDX + pragma + state + constructor + functions
     2. Key function implementation (state-changing function with event)
     3. Truffle migration script
     4. Hardhat test — constructor and function call test
     5. Web3.js or ethers.js interaction script (optional, if used)
     Refer to docs/EXP-X_DOC_RULE.md §7.1 for snippet rules. -->

---

### OUTPUT

<!-- TODO: Add screenshots saved in Exp-2/screenshots/.
     Minimum required:
       Fig 2.1 — Truffle compile: contracts compiled successfully
       Fig 2.2 — Truffle migrate: contract deployed to development network
       Fig 2.3 — Hardhat test suite or Truffle test: all tests passing
     Follow naming: fig-2.Y-description.png (kebab-case, no spaces).
     Refer to docs/EXP-X_DOC_RULE.md §7.2 for screenshot rules. -->

---

## LAB OUTCOMES

<!-- TODO: Copy verbatim from docs/BLOCKCHAIN_LAB_MANUAL.md -->
**LO2** — Develop and test smart contract on Ethereum test networks.

---

## CONCLUSION

<!-- TODO: Write exactly 2–3 sentences.
     Mandatory opener: "We have successfully..."
     Mention: contract name, Solidity, Truffle/Hardhat, LO2 achieved.
     No bullet points. Refer to docs/EXP-X_DOC_RULE.md §9. -->
