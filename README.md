## Overview

This repository contains all the **practical experiments** for the **Blockchain Technology Lab**
(**ITL801**) course prescribed by the **University of Mumbai** for the Bachelor of Engineering
(Information Technology) programme, Semester VIII.

The experiments cover core concepts in blockchain development, smart contract programming, and
decentralized application (DApp) architecture using industry-standard toolchains including
**Hardhat**, **Truffle**, **Ganache**, **Remix IDE**, and **Foundry**.

## Quick Start

Before working with any experiment, set up your development environment by following the
dependency installation guide:

**[docs/DEPENDENCY.md](docs/DEPENDENCY.md)** — Step-by-step setup for Windows and WSL/Linux covering:
- Node.js LTS (via `nvm`)
- Hardhat, Truffle, Ganache, Foundry
- Remix IDE + Remixd
- MetaMask browser wallet

After installing dependencies, configure your VS Code editor:

**[docs/EXTENSION.md](docs/EXTENSION.md)** — Required and recommended VS Code extensions for the `Web3` profile.
